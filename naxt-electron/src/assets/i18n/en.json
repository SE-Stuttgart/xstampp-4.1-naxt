At the same time, they have changed the nature of accidents and increased the\n              potential to harm not only life today but also future generations.",
      "TEXT22": "Traditional system safety approaches, which started in the missile defense systems of the 1950s, are being\n              challenged by the introduction of new technology and the increasing complexity of the systems we are\n              attempting to build. Software is changing the causes of accidents and the humans operating these systems\n              have a much more difficult job than simply following predefined procedures. We can no longer effectively\n              separate engineering design from human factors and from the social and organizational system in which our\n              systems are designed and operated.",
      "TEXT23": "To tackle these challenges, we need to apply systems thinking and take a systems approach to safety.",
      "TEXT24": "STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) is the name of the new accident causality model\n              based on systems theory. It expands traditional models that focus on individual component failures or\n              chains of directly-related failure events to include more complex processes and unsafe interactions among\n              system components. Safety is treated as a dynamic control problem rather than a “prevent failures”\n              problem. The STAMP model includes traditional component failures but also considers design flaws,\n              incomplete or inadequate requirements, dysfunctional interactions among subsystems or components (all of\n              which may be operating exactly as specified), human interactions, and other causes of accidents and\n              incidents. With STAMP, the emphasis changes from simply preventing failures to enforcing constraints on\n              system behavior and interactions.",

      "TEXT29": "It allows creating more powerful tools, such as STPA (hazard analysis), safety-guided design, CAST\n                (analyzing previous accidents), identification and management of leading indicators of increasing risk,\n                organizational risk analysis, etc.",
